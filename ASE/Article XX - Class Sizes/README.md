**UAW Proposal 1**

This is a new article that UAW has proposed adding to the contract. It requires:

1. Projected class sizes:
- Departments post projected class sizes to a campus website at least 90 days before the start of the academic year.

2. Class size policies:
- Departments create class size policies that state, at a minimum, the maximum number of students per section and the maximum ratio of students to ASEs per class.

3. Override procedures:
- Departments create policy and process for overriding maximums, but no ASE is required to accept more students than the policy max.

4. Disputes:
- If ASE believes class size will increase workload or hamper educational objectives, the University must hire additional staff, increase number of sections, or increase ASE's appointment percentage.
- ASE can appeal to arbitration.

**UAW Proposal 2**

The 2nd proposal submitted in May was identitical to Proposal 1. The October proposal is the true Proposal 2.

1. Introduction:
- UAW replaced reference to large class sizes impacting "quality of instruction" with impacting "intensity of work".

2. Projected class sizes:
- UAW amended 90 days' notice down to 60.

3. Disputes:
- UAW removed all formal dispute procedures and replaced with a statement that ASEs should notify supervisors if their class size will increase the "intensity of their work" above the department norm. There is no longer any requirement for the supervisor or department to do anything in response to such notification.
