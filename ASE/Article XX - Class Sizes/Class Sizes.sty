ARTICLE XX
CLASS SIZES

Recognizing that the size of classes has an impact on the workload of Academic Student Employees and the quality of instruction, the University and the Union agree that:

1. Ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the academic year, every academic department shall post the projected class sizes for the departmentâ€™s courses to a central campus website.

2. Each department employing ASEs will establish a class size policy in conjunction with ASE representatives for classes to which ASEs are assigned. This class size policy will include, but need not be limited to, the maximum number of students in each section (recognizing the potential for reduction within sections with regard to programmatic need) and the maximum ratio of students to ASEs.

a. The class size policy will be provided to ASEs in their appointment letter, per Article 2.
b. Changes to departmental class size policies shall be subject to the Waiver provisions of the Agreement, per Article 31.

3. The department will have available, in writing, the method(s) for handling override authorization forms and person(s) who are authorized signers. No ASEs shall be required to accept enrollees in excess of the maximum class or section size.

4. Dispute Process

a. An ASEs shall notify their supervisor if they believe their class size will increase their normal workload or hamper educational outcomes
b. The University shall either:

i. Hire additional course staff
ii. Add additional sections to the course
iii. Increase appointment percentage

c. Should the issue not be resolved to the ASE's satisfaction, the ASEs may directly appeal their case to Arbitration, per Article 12.
