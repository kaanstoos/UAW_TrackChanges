**UAW Proposal 1**

1. Affirmative Action and Diversity:
- UAW removed the affirmative action programs from UC's exclusive rights to manage and added a new clause stating that such programs require action by all stakeholders and thus the Univeristy's exlusive right is limited by other articles in the contract.

2. Safety and Order:
- UAW removed the UC's exlusive right to set, maintain, and enforce standards of "conduct, order, and safety" and instead added a new clause stating that the UC's right to enforce campus safety is limited by other articles in the contract.

3. Subcontracting:
- UAW removed the UC's exclusive right to subcontract operations and added a clause prohibiting the UC from subcontracting work in lieu of assigning it to existing employees or expanding employment opportunities with scope of current contracts.

**UC Proposal 1 - Comprehensive Package**

- UC reformatted the first clause to make it a numbered list rather than a paragraph, and reordered many of the items within that list.

1. Affirmative Action:
- UC removed the separate clause on this, but did not return it as an exclusive right.

Safety and Order:
- UC returned the original exclusive right to "establish, maintain, modify and or enforce standards of workplace performance, conduct, order and safety" and removed the separate clause on campus safety.

3. Subcontracting:
- UC returned the exclusive right to subcontract and removed the separate clause on it.

4. Other Exclusive Rights Added:
- UC added right to establish, direct, and control the University's organizational structure and operations.
- UC added right to "recruit, appoint, reappoint, not reappoint, and transfer unit members and to determine and modify the size and composition of the work force".
- UC added right to "introduce new or improved methods" and "programs".
- UC split existing right to "to assign work locations" into "determine the work location or relocation, reorganization, or discontinuance of operations" and "assign ASEâ€™s individual work locations".
- UC added right to "determine and modify job qualifications, requirements, classifications, and descriptions".
- UC added to the right to assign ASEs specifying that it includes the right "to direct, assign, train, and otherwise supervise unit employees".
- UC added to the dismissal clause the right to "establish and modify standards of workplace conduct".
- UC added right to "establish, maintain, modify and or enforce standards of workplace performance, conduct, order and safety".
- UC added "policies and safety procedures" to the right to establish rules and regulations.
- UC added all of these new exclusive rights -
"18. to determine and manage campus housing pursuant to University policies;
19. to determine cost and coverage of student benefits including health, dental, vision, and other medical insurance and prescription drug policies;
20. to select all insurance carriers and to change carriers from time to time;
21. to investigate and determine matters of sexual harassment, discrimination and personal misconduct;
22. or to subcontract all or any portion of any operations;
23. and to exercise sole authority on all decisions involving academic matters."

**UAW Proposal 2 - Comprehensive Package**

Note: this article of the comprehensive package appears to have mistakenly copied over the GSR version. There are several clauses added which are not relevant to ASEs, and the entire article refers to GSRs instead of ASEs. Ignoring these differences, UAW proposed the following changes:

- UAW slightly modified the introductory wording to make the modification of rights in other parts of the Agreement less restrictive.
- UAW reordered many of the items in the exclusive rights list.

1. New Exclusive Rights:
- UAW modified the UC-added right to determine and manage campus housing to say: "To determine and modify policies and financial costs and charges associated with student University housing; to determine and manage campus housing pursuant to University policies."

2. Subcontracting:
- UAW removed the right to subcontract work (note: this may be because this is the GSR version).

3. Academic Matters:
- UAW changed UC sole discretion over financial aid to "Federal and State Financial Aid".
