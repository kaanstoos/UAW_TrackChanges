ARTICLE 18
MANAGEMENT AND ACADEMIC RIGHTS

A. Management of the University is vested exclusively in the University. Except as otherwise provided in this agreement, the UAW agrees that the University has the right to establish, plan, direct and control the University’s missions, programs, objectives, activities, resources, and priorities; to establish and administer procedures, rules and regulations, and direct and control University operations; to alter, extend, or discontinue existing equipment, facilities, and location of operations; to determine or modify the number, qualifications, scheduling, responsibilities and assignment of ASEs; to establish, maintain, modify or enforce standards of performance; to determine the content of evaluations, and to determine the processes and criteria by which ASEs’ performance is evaluated; to establish and require ASEs to observe University rules and regulations; to discipline or dismiss ASEs; to establish or modify the academic calendars, including holidays and holiday scheduling; to assign work locations; to schedule hours of work; to recruit, hire, or transfer; to determine how and by whom instruction is delivered; to introduce new methods of instruction.

B. Decisions regarding who is taught, what is taught, how it is taught and who does the teaching involve academic judgment and shall be made at the sole discretion of the University.

C. The above enumeration of management rights is not exhaustive and does not exclude other management rights not specified herein, nor shall the exercise or non-exercise of rights constitute a waiver of any such rights by the University.

D. No action taken by the University with respect to a management or academic right, except as otherwise provided in this agreement, shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure or collateral suit, unless the exercise thereof violates an express written provision of this agreement.

E. The University and the Union agree that diversity, equity, and inclusion in hiring is a priority for building a more inclusive and representative UC. The parties also agree that building a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive University requires that all stakeholders including the University and the Union take an active role in improving the campus climate for everyone. Therefore, the parties agree that the University’s Management Rights related to Affirmative Action plans and goals are limited by other parts of the agreement.

F. The University and the Union agree that campus safety is an issue affecting every student and employee on campus. In an effort to ensure the safety of all ASEs,
particularly those who face racial discrimination, the University and the Union agree that the University’s Management Rights related to campus safety are limited by other parts of the agreement.

G. The University shall not subcontract work of any kind in lieu of assigning work to represented employees or expanding employment opportunities within the scope of its current agreements.
