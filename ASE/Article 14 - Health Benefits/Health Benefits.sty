ARTICLE 14
HEALTH BENEFITS

A. Eligible ASEs may participate in a University-sponsored student health insurance plan to the same degree other eligible students at that campus participate. University-sponsored student health insurance plans include the multi-campus UC Student Health Insurance Plan (UC SHIP) administered by the UC Office of the President, and Graduate Student Health Insurance Plans administered by specific campuses who have elected not to participate in UC SHIP.

1. The benefits offered to ASEs, including, but not limited to, medical, dental and vision, shall be the same on every University of California campus, and shall be no less than the plan with the highest actuarial value of benefits in plan year 2021-22. Further, covered procedures for any given diagnosis code shall be consistent across campuses. Benefit parity shall occur with no increase in premiums during the life of the agreement.

B. An ASE who is a registered student with ASE appointment(s) or other eligible academic appointments totaling 25% or more of full-time for a given term in a State-supported or Self-Supporting Program is eligible to receive remission of premium for a University-sponsored student health insurance plan for themselves and their dependents. An ASE is eligible to receive premium remission per term for themselves and each of their dependents. In the event premiums increase, the University will continue to provide 100% premium remissions to eligible ASEs and their dependents.

C. The University-sponsored student health insurance plans are student health insurance programs for registered students, and the eligibility for and the availability of these programs are not related to a student’s status as an ASE.

D. An ASE who is not a registered student and who is not eligible to participate in a University-sponsored student health insurance plan will be eligible to participate in the non-student University Health Insurance program in the same manner as non-represented, non-senate academic employees.

1. Eligibility to participate in the employee University Health Insurance Program will be in accordance with the University Health Program provisions.
2. The University will cover all costs of the University Health Insurance Program.

E. The University shall improve and expand University-sponsored student health insurance plan benefits and services.

F. The University and the UAW shall meet twice a year to discuss the University-sponsored student health insurance plans. Appropriate topics for discussions are those health insurance related issues that apply to ASE’s including systemwide participation in UCSHIP, potential changes in benefits, deductibles, and co-pays.

The University agrees to provide up to 4 hours of paid release time (including travel) to one ASE per campus for the purpose of attending systemwide meetings. The first such meeting shall take place during the first quarter of fiscal

G. The University and the Union shall meet quarterly to discuss integration of ASEs and Student Researchers into the Postdoctoral Scholar Health and Welfare Plans or creating an employee healthcare plan for Academic Student Employees and Student Researchers, in order to implement such integration by plan year 2023-24.
