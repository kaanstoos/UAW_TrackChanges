**UAW Proposal 1**

This is a new article proposed by UAW. It requires:

1. Defund UCPD:
- UAW proposed that UC defund budgets directed to the UCPD.

2. No external police for UC events:
- UAW proposed that UC refrain from calling external law enforcement agencies to respond to UC-campus events.

3. No punishment for avoiding police presence:
- UAW proposed that ASEs be notified if there will be any non-campus law enforcement officers in their workplace vicinity (how many, where, why).
- UAW proposed that ASEs be safe from retaliation and still receive full pay if they do not come to campus due to police presence in their workplace vicinity.
