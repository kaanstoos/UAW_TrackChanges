COMMUNITY SAFETY

A. In an effort to ensure the safety of all ASEs, particularly those who face discrimination, the University of California Office of the President will defund the budgets dedicated to the University of California Police Departmentâ€™s.

B. The University shall also refrain from calling local, municipal, county, state, or federal law enforcement to respond to events on campus.

C. In the event that non-campus law enforcement officers enter campus, on-campus ASEs will be notified, with information about: the number of police and security personnel predicted to be on campus, what agency the law enforcement officers are part of, their reason for being on campus, the duration of their presence, and their location(s) on campus. ASEs shall not be punished, retaliated against, or otherwise penalized for not coming to campus if there are additional police or law enforcement officers, regardless of agency, within their workplace vicinity. ASEs shall be paid in full for any time taken off due to police presence.
