ARTICLE 11
FEE REMISSIONS

A. ELIGIBILITY

An ASE who is a registered graduate student with (an) ASE appointment(s) or other eligible academic appointment(s) totaling 25% or more of full-time for a given term is eligible to participate in the University’s Partial Fee Remission Program for Tuition and the Student Services Fee.

An ASE who is a registered undergraduate student appointed in Teaching Assistant title codes TC 2310 or TC 2311 with an appointment totaling 25% or more of full-time for a given term is eligible to participate in the University’s Partial Fee Remission Program for Tuition and the Student Services Fee.

An ASE is eligible to receive only one Partial Fee Remission per term.

B. PARTIAL FEE REMISSION

For those ASEs eligible for a Partial Fee Remission, the University will provide:
1. a Partial Fee Remission of 100% of Tuition and the Student Services Fee;
2. a Partial Fee Remission to cover 100% of campus fees, not to exceed the maximum campus fees for each campus. This provision shall be effective for academic year 2023-2024.
3. Full Remission of Non-Resident Supplemental Tuition

C. FEE EQUIVALENCY FOR ASEs ENROLLED IN SELF-SUPPORTING PROGRAMS

An ASE who is a registered graduate student with (an) ASE appointment(s) totaling 25% or more, who is enrolled in a self-supporting graduate degree program and is employed by either a UC self-supporting program or a UC state-supported graduate program, shall be eligible to receive a partial fee remission equivalent in dollar amount to what an eligible ASE enrolled in a UC state-supported program would receive for tuition and student services fee, as a result of the qualifying appointment. In no case will that remission exceed the total charges paid by the ASE to the self-supporting program. Self-supporting graduate degree programs that are subject to this provision are only those programs which have an approved self-supporting fee or charge approved in writing by the UC President.
