ARTICLE XX
HOUSING

A. Rent in all UC-controlled housing units available to bargaining unit members shall not exceed 30% of the base wage level of a 50% FTE Teaching Assistant. Additionally, throughout the life of the contract, the University shall not annually increase rent in any housing unit available to bargaining unit members by more than the regional Consumer Price Index.

B. The University shall provide affordable on-campus housing per Section A above for international bargaining unit members who relocate to the U.S. to work for the University and who are actively seeking off-campus housing.

C. Housing Guarantee

1. The University shall guarantee five (5) years of quality, safe, affordable, and well-maintained UC-controlled housing per Section A above to every bargaining unit member, including sufficient housing rented on a per-unit basis for disabled bargaining unit members and those with dependents and families.

2. The University and Union shall meet to assess the capacity of current on-campus housing to satisfy this guarantee. Where existing on-campus housing is insufficient, the University and Union shall determine the number of new university-controlled units needed at each campus and shall jointly develop and implement a timely plan for additional quality, affordable housing construction, accessible to campus by public transportation, to meet those numerical goals.

D. University Housing Units

1. Until such time as the University has fully met its obligations under Section C above, the University shall provide written notice to the union when it has determined how many University housing units will be made available for use by bargaining unit members. The union may request, within fifteen (15) days of such notice, that the parties begin bargaining pursuant to the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) on all issues that are mandatory subjects of bargaining under HEERA related to the implementation of University housing for bargaining unit members. Such matters include, but are not limited to, rental rates, location of housing units, maintenance and upkeep and process and criteria for the assignment of available units.

2. If the union makes such a request to bargain, the University agrees to commence negotiations no later than thirty (30) days after the partiesâ€™ initial proposals have been made public pursuant to HEERA.
