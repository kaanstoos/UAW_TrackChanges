ARTICLE XX
HOUSING

A. Rent in all UC-controlled housing units available to bargaining unit members shall not exceed 30% of the base wage level of a 50% FTE Teaching Assistant. Additionally, throughout the life of the contract, the University shall not annually increase rent in any housing unit available to bargaining unit members by more than the regional Consumer Price Index.

B. The University shall guarantee five (5) years of quality, safe, affordable, and well-maintained UC-controlled housing per Section A above to disabled bargaining unit members, those with dependents and families, and international bargaining unit members who relocate to the U.S. to work for the University and who are actively seeking off-campus housing.

C. The University shall provide written notice to the union when it intends to change the number of housing units available to bargaining unit members or terms and conditions of units housing bargaining unit members. The union may request, within fifteen (15) days of such notice, that the parties begin bargaining pursuant to the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) regarding these changes to rental rates or housing availability. If the union makes such a request to bargain, the University agrees to commence negotiations no later than thirty (30) days after the partiesâ€™ initial proposals have been made public pursuant to HEERA.
